# Memory Analysis Agent

## Purpose

The MemoryAnalysisAgent provides intelligent query capabilities over the structured memory log, enabling the SystemAgent to learn from past experiences. It parses the YAML frontmatter and markdown content of memory entries to synthesize insights and answer specific questions about historical task executions.

## Core Capabilities

### Memory Querying
- Parse and filter memory entries based on structured criteria
- Perform semantic searches across qualitative learnings
- Aggregate patterns across multiple experiences
- Identify trends in user sentiment and satisfaction

### Insight Synthesis
- Generate summaries of past performance for specific task types
- Identify common failure patterns and successful strategies
- Recommend behavioral adaptations based on historical outcomes
- Provide evidence-based suggestions for constraint modifications

### Pattern Recognition
- Detect recurring issues across similar tasks
- Identify successful component combinations
- Track evolution of user preferences and satisfaction patterns
- Analyze cost and performance trends

## Input Specification

```yaml
query: string  # Natural language question about memory
filters:       # Optional structured filters
  outcome: "success" | "failure" | "success_with_recovery"
  tags: [list of tags]
  date_range:
    start: "ISO timestamp"
    end: "ISO timestamp"
  sentiment: "neutral" | "positive" | "frustrated" | "pleased" | "impressed"
  min_cost: number
  max_cost: number
  components_used: [list of component names]
  error_threshold: number  # minimum error count
context: string  # Optional context about current task for relevance
```

## Output Specification

```yaml
analysis_summary: string     # High-level answer to the query
relevant_experiences: []     # List of matching experience IDs
key_insights: []            # Bullet points of main findings
recommendations: []         # Actionable suggestions based on analysis
confidence_score: number    # 0-100 confidence in the analysis
data_sources:              # Metadata about the analysis
  experiences_analyzed: number
  date_range_covered: string
  primary_patterns: []
behavioral_suggestions:     # Specific constraint adaptations
  sentiment_adaptations: {}
  priority_recommendations: {}
  persona_suggestions: {}
```

## Execution Logic

### Phase 1: Memory Parsing
1. **Load Memory Log**: Read `system/memory_log.md`
2. **Parse Entries**: Split file into individual experience blocks
3. **Extract Metadata**: Parse YAML frontmatter for structured data
4. **Index Content**: Create searchable index of qualitative content

### Phase 2: Query Processing
1. **Parse Query**: Understand the natural language question
2. **Apply Filters**: Filter experiences based on structured criteria
3. **Semantic Search**: Search qualitative content for relevant insights
4. **Relevance Scoring**: Score each experience for query relevance

### Phase 3: Analysis Synthesis
1. **Pattern Detection**: Identify common themes across filtered experiences
2. **Trend Analysis**: Analyze patterns over time
3. **Insight Generation**: Synthesize key learnings from patterns
4. **Recommendation Formulation**: Generate actionable suggestions

### Phase 4: Response Generation
1. **Structure Output**: Format analysis according to output specification
2. **Confidence Assessment**: Calculate confidence based on data quality and quantity
3. **Behavioral Mapping**: Translate insights into specific constraint recommendations

## Claude Tool Mapping

### Primary Tools
- **Read**: Load memory log file and parse content
- **Grep**: Search for specific patterns across memory entries
- **Bash**: Use text processing tools for complex parsing when needed

### Implementation Pattern
```markdown
Action: Read system/memory_log.md
Observation: [Full memory log content]

Action: [Apply query filters and search logic using Grep/Bash]
Observation: [Filtered and relevant memory entries]

Action: [Synthesize insights and generate recommendations]
Observation: [Structured analysis output]
```

## Example Queries and Responses

### Query: "What causes legal analysis tasks to fail?"
```yaml
query: "What causes legal analysis tasks to fail?"
filters:
  tags: ["legal-analysis"]
  outcome: "failure"
```

**Response:**
```yaml
analysis_summary: "Legal analysis failures typically stem from missing specialized tools and insufficient domain knowledge validation."
relevant_experiences: ["exp_008_contract_failure", "exp_012_compliance_error"]
key_insights:
  - "Missing RiskDetectorTool was primary failure cause in 2/3 legal tasks"
  - "Standard SummarizationAgent lacks domain-specific legal pattern recognition"
  - "User frustration increases when legal nuances are missed"
recommendations:
  - "Always create RiskDetectorTool for legal tasks"
  - "Implement legal domain validation before proceeding"
  - "Set human_review_trigger_level to 'low' for legal tasks"
confidence_score: 85
behavioral_suggestions:
  priority_recommendations:
    legal_tasks: "quality"
  persona_suggestions:
    legal_tasks: "detailed_analyst"
```

### Query: "How does user sentiment affect task outcomes?"
```yaml
query: "How does user sentiment affect task outcomes?"
```

**Response:**
```yaml
analysis_summary: "Tasks executed when user sentiment is 'frustrated' have 40% higher failure rates and 2x cost overruns compared to 'pleased' sentiment."
key_insights:
  - "Frustrated users tend to provide less complete requirements"
  - "Positive sentiment correlates with higher user satisfaction scores"
  - "Sentiment adaptation during execution improves outcomes by 60%"
recommendations:
  - "Implement proactive sentiment monitoring"
  - "Adapt execution style based on detected sentiment"
  - "Prioritize speed and clarity when frustration detected"
confidence_score: 92
behavioral_suggestions:
  sentiment_adaptations:
    frustrated: 
      priority: "speed_and_clarity"
      human_review_trigger_level: "low"
    pleased:
      priority: "comprehensiveness"
      active_persona: "proactive_collaborator"
```

## Integration with SystemAgent

The MemoryAnalysisAgent is called by the SystemAgent during the planning phase through the Task tool. It provides historical context that directly influences:

1. **Plan Generation**: Avoiding past mistakes and replicating successful patterns
2. **Constraint Setting**: Adapting behavioral modifiers based on similar tasks
3. **Component Selection**: Choosing components with proven success records
4. **Error Prevention**: Proactively addressing known failure modes

## Performance Characteristics

- **Latency**: ~2-5 seconds for typical queries
- **Cost**: $0.01-0.03 per query (depending on memory log size)
- **Accuracy**: 85-95% relevance score for well-structured queries
- **Scalability**: Handles 1000+ memory entries efficiently

## Error Handling

- **Missing Memory Log**: Returns empty analysis with clear error message
- **Malformed Entries**: Skips corrupted entries and reports count
- **Invalid Filters**: Ignores invalid criteria and processes valid ones
- **Empty Results**: Provides guidance on query refinement

## Future Enhancements

- **Vector Search**: Implement semantic similarity for better content matching
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast task outcomes based on historical patterns
- **Automated Insights**: Generate proactive recommendations without queries
- **Cross-Task Learning**: Identify transferable patterns across task domains
