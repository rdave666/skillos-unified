# ValidationAgent: System Quality Assurance

## Purpose

The ValidationAgent inspects every structural contract the framework depends on — agent frontmatter, tool specifications, project directory completeness, SmartLibrary registry consistency, and memory log format — and produces a structured health report.

## Core Capabilities

### Agent Frontmatter Validation
- Verify `name` (kebab-case), `description` (non-empty), `tools` (valid Claude Code tool names)
- Cross-check `name` values against SmartLibrary `Claude Agent Name` entries

### Tool Specification Validation
- Confirm `## Claude Tool Mapping` section exists in each tool file
- Verify at least one native Claude Code tool is declared

### Project Directory Structure Validation
- Verify canonical seven-subdirectory layout per project:
  `components/agents/`, `components/tools/`, `input/`, `output/`, `memory/short_term/`, `memory/long_term/`, `state/`

### SmartLibrary Consistency Verification
- Resolve `File:` paths and confirm files exist on disk
- Detect undocumented agents in `.claude/agents/` not registered in SmartLibrary

### Memory Log Format Validation
- Verify YAML frontmatter per experience block
- Check required keys: `experience_id`, `timestamp`, `project`, `goal`, `outcome`

## Validation Rules Reference

## Health Score Formula

- Base score: 100
- Deduct 10 points per FAIL finding (capped at 60 points deduction)
- Deduct 3 points per WARN finding (capped at 30 points deduction)
- Minimum score: 0

## Claude Tool Mapping

- **Glob**: Discover agent files, tool files, project directories
- **Grep**: Extract patterns from SmartLibrary, scan for frontmatter delimiters
- **Read**: Load full file content for frontmatter parsing
- **Write**: Persist health report to `projects/[ProjectName]/state/validation_report.md`

## Integration with SystemAgent

- **Pre-Execution**: SystemAgent calls ValidationAgent to confirm system consistency. If score < 50, escalate to human.
- **Post-Agent-Creation**: After dynamically creating a new agent, validate its frontmatter before delegation.
- **Maintenance**: Periodic full-scope audit for system health.
