    """
    Merge new evidence with existing patterns using confidence weighting
    """
    confidence_existing = existing_pattern.confidence
    confidence_new = calculate_confidence(new_evidence)

    # Weighted merge based on confidence levels
    merged_pattern = weighted_merge(
        existing_pattern,
        new_evidence,
        weight_existing=confidence_existing,
        weight_new=confidence_new
    )

    # Update confidence based on consistency
    merged_pattern.confidence = calculate_updated_confidence(
        existing_pattern, new_evidence, merged_pattern
    )

    return merged_pattern
```
